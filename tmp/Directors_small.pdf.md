The Board may, from time to time, at their absolute discretion select any Eligible Person for participation in any scheme as a selected grantee (the "Selected Grantee") and determine the number of shares to be awarded or make reference to a nominal amount. The relevant number of shares awarded will be purchased by the trustee of the schemes from the market or new shares will be subscribed for by the trustee at the cost of the Company and be held in trust until they are vested. Upon acceptance of the share awards, no payment is required. When a Selected Grantee has satisfied all vesting conditions specified by the Board, the trustee will transfer the relevant vested shares together with the income derived therefrom (net of accrued interest) to such Selected Grantee.

The maximum number of shares which can be awarded under each scheme is 10% of the issued share capital of the Company as at the adoption date thereof, and the maximum number of shares which can be awarded under each scheme to a Selected Grantee, at any one time, shall not in aggregate exceed 1% of the issued share capital of the Company as at the adoption date thereof. The total issued share capital of the Company as at the 2008 Adoption Date and the 2018 Adoption Date were 1,501,252,152 shares and 1,835,021,941 shares, respectively.

Since the 2018 Adoption Date and up to December 31, 2022, a total of 12,658,500 shares had been awarded under the 2018 Share Award Scheme, representing 0.69% of the issued share capital of the Company as at the 2018 Adoption Date. Recognition of share-based payment expenses under the 2018 Share Award Scheme during the year was US\$31,980,000. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a total of 3,011,000 shares had been awarded under the 2018 Share Award Scheme to two Directors of the Company, representing 0.16% of the issued share capital of the Company as at the 2018 Adoption Date. The total payout, including related expenses, amounted to US\$52,112,000. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, 1,784,500 shares were transferred to nine Directors and a Selected Grantee upon vesting under the 2018 Share Award Scheme.

#### Share Options

#### Share Option Schemes

The Company has two share option schemes in place – Scheme D and Scheme E. Scheme D was adopted on May 29, 2007 and expired on May 28, 2017, though its provisions shall remain in full force and effect in all other respects. Following the expiry of Scheme D, Scheme E was adopted on May 19, 2017 and will expire on May 18, 2027.

Both Scheme D and Scheme E are aimed for recognition of the contribution to the development and growth of the Group by the eligible persons. The scheme rules of both Scheme D and Scheme E are substantially identical and below are the summary of the principal terms of both schemes:

The Board of Directors of the Company may grant share options to the following eligible persons (and their wholly owned companies) of the Company, its subsidiaries and any companies in which the Group holds any equity interest, to subscribe for shares in the Company:

- (i) employees; or
- (ii) Directors; or
- (iii) secondees; or
- (iv) any shareholders of any member of the Group or invested entity or controlling shareholders or any holders of any securities issued by any member of the Group; or
- (v) business partners; or
- (vi) suppliers; or
- (vii) customers; or
- (viii) advisers of the Group.

Share options granted must be taken up within 21 days of the date of grant, upon payment of consideration to be determined by the Board for the grant thereof. Share options may be exercised at any time, subject to vesting conditions, from the date of grant to the tenth anniversary thereof. The subscription price is set at the highest of: the closing price of the shares on the date of offer of the share option or the average closing price of shares as stated in the daily quotation sheets issued by the Stock Exchange for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of offer.

The maximum number of shares in respect of which share options may be granted under the respective share option schemes is not permitted to exceed 30.0% of the issued share capital of the Company from time to time or 10.0% of the shares in issue as at the adoption date of the respective share option schemes. No person shall be granted an option which exceeds 1.0% of the shares in issue as at the date of offer in any 12-month period up to the date thereof.

Options may be exercised at any time after the first to third anniversary of the date of grant of the share option to the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. The exercise price is determined by the Directors of the Company, and will not be less than the higher of (i) the closing price of the Company's shares on the date of grant; and (ii) the average closing price of the shares for the five business days immediately preceding the date of grant.
